SmartQA is a domain-specific, modular test automation framework designed for enterprise applications with complex, multi-step UI workflows and deeply nested data structures such as financial tables, HR portals, and ERP systems.
SmartQA solves this gap with a domain-specific testing framework offering:
•	Smart element mapping for deeply nested UI elements (tables, modals, rows, components)
•	Precondition chaining for sequential workflows (e.g., HR onboarding, loan applications, order processing)
•	Content-aware assertions: built-in converters for currency, date, formula fields, etc.
•	Seamless integration with CI/CD pipelines and GitHub workflows
•	Built on stable Java/Selenium stack with low learning curve and full documentation
